## Py1620 (IBM 1620 emulator)

This **[IBM 1620](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1620) emulator in Python** can now run the famous IBM 1620 baseball game. Also included are the [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/)'s [Power of Two](https://github.com/IBM-1620/Junior/blob/master/diagnostics/binaries/APP_Power_Of_2.cmem) demo program, 2D tic-tac-toe from the 1620 General Program Library, and "99 Bottles of Beer" by Chuck Guzis among others. This README demonstrates various games and demo programs for the 1620 and also shows how to run Fortran, GOTRAN, and assembly programs.

The emulated machine is an **IBM 1620 Model 1 with 20,000 decimal digits of memory plus the optional divide instructions**. Other special features (such as indirect addressing or floating point instructions) are not supported. The addition and multiplication tables in 1620 memory are not used but standard Python integer math. **Input and output are done via punch cards (= text files) and the typewriter (= terminal).**

Also see my [IBM1620-Baseball](https://github.com/mdoege/IBM1620-Baseball) repo for additional IBM 1620 tools and documentation.

### Emulator usage

#### Running the emulator

```python3 py1620.py input.txt [0000] [output.txt]```

where input.txt is either a **card reader input file** in SIMH format or a CMEM core memory file, 0000 are the (optional) **sense switch settings**, and output.txt is the **card punch output file** (optional).

E.g., to run the baseball game with sense switch 3 set to on (= play only a single game):

```python3 py1620.py base.txt 0010```

To run the slot machine / one-armed bandit, playing for 50 cents (sense switch 4):

```python3 py1620.py band.txt 0001```

Without any arguments, the tic-tac-toe game is loaded.

#### Emulator options and other useful hints

* On Linux, you can make **tabular output** from the baseball and blackjack games line up properly by first setting the terminal's **tab stops** with the ```tabs``` command, e.g. ```tabs -18``` for the baseball game and ```tabs -16``` for blackjack.

* Machine **memory size** (```MSIZE```) is defined on line 40 of py1620.py. The IBM 1620 was also available with **40,000 or 60,000 digits of memory** and supported up to 100,000 digits in principle. However, some programs (like the day of the week program) will not work with memory sizes larger than 20k, therefore this remains the default. The **Fortran compiler** especially benefits from 40k digits or more, as its symbol table is limited to 200 entries on 20k systems, which is not enough to compile larger programs.

* If the ```SLOW``` parameter on line 7 of py1620.py is set to True, **terminal output speed will be limited to 10 characters per second** like a typewriter on a real IBM 1620. This setting makes sense especially for the baseball game and the 99 bottles of beer demo, because otherwise output will scroll by much too fast to read.

* Py1620 uses a **Unicode** combining character to display overbars for digits with an active flag bit. These overbars may not look all that great with some terminal fonts, e.g. they may be shifted horizontally in respect to the digit below. Switching to a **different terminal font** with better overbar support (like [GNU Unifont](https://unifoundry.com/unifont/)) will solve this issue.

#### Built-in debugger

**Pressing Ctrl-C enters the debugger**, where "h" prints help, "q" quits the emulator, and "c" (or just Return) continues emulation. When the machine halts for another reason (e.g. a halt instruction, a breakpoint, etc.), this will also trigger the debugger, with the prompt showing the reason for halting (```halt, break, step, watch, user, error```).

**Output from the help command** looks like this:
```
halt> h
    Available commands when system is halted:
      p        attach a punch card reader input file
      d        save memory dump
      e        examine memory
      s        show current sense switch settings
      t        toggle a sense switch with t1, t2, t3, t4
      i        show indicators
      m        manual mode (= single-step mode)
      a        auto mode
      g        set PC to value
      c        continue (or just press Return)
      q        quit emulator
    PC = 0; print current instruction with: e 0/12
```

**Memory dumps** need [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io) to output a PNG that shows memory contents. Dumps also inlcude ```mem.txt```, which is in the same format as a SIMH memory dump (from ```e 0/20000```) for easy diffing.

The ```DEBUG``` flag in line 6 of py1620.py enables **logging a CPU trace** to ```cmd.txt```.

#### Rosetta Code examples

The ```rosetta_code/``` directory contains four assembly programs which were created for [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:IBM_1620_SPS): **a cellular automaton, Fibonacci numbers, FizzBuzz, and the Mandelbrot set**. Except for the Mandelbrot set (which requires floating-point instructions), all programs work in Py1620.

Assembly was done with [SPS1620](https://github.com/IBM-1620/SPS1620), a Java-based cross-assembler, to create the CRD/CMEM/LST output files.

The TXT files on the other hand have been assembled in Py1620 with the SPS assembler. The main difference is that the TXT binaries will halt after loading.

### Why emulate the IBM 1620?

The **decimal-based IBM 1620** (codename CADET) computer was intended for science and engineering applications and was, like its business-oriented counterpart the IBM 1401 (codename SPACE), part of IBM's late 1950s effort to produce **smaller, more affordable computers** using the latest technology (core memory, transistors) that would appeal to budget-conscious first-time buyers such as **Universities and mid-size business**. Both computers were announced in 1959, were very successful in their respective niches and were often in use into the early 1970s. They were also kept alive by **emulation**, as IBM 360-type mainframes supported emulating them.

In practice, the **1620 feels similar in some ways to an early DEC PDP** such as the PDP-8, but also opposite in other aspects, which makes it an interesting target for emulation. Both the 1620 and the PDP-8 could be considered early personal computers, apart from their high price tags and more limited production runs.

**Similarities between the 1620 and a PDP-8 include**: They are friendly minicomputers, not too expensive (by the standards of the day), ideal for interactive use and games. Their basic operation is quite simple, with just the computer, a terminal (teletype/typewriter), and input/output via paper media required. Magnetic storage media were supported but optional for most software (making it easier to write an emulator for these machines). An operating system is not needed; most programs run on bare metal.

But in many ways the **1620 and a PDP are also very different**: punch cards (1620) vs paper tape (PDP), variable-length decimal (1620) vs binary words (PDP), a machine language that is high-level (1620) vs one that is extremely low-level (PDP-8), and booting the machine automatically from punch cards (1620) vs toggling in a paper tape loader via the front panel (PDP).

The main reasons why the **1620 is relatively obscure today** compared to the more ubiquitous DEC PDP are probably that fewer 1620s were built, that they were more expensive, and that IBM customers typically rented their machines rather than purchased them, therefore fewer 1620s still exist today.

A major **advantage of the 1620 for emulation** is that a lot of software for the system has survived on punch cards, mainly from Bitsavers and the CHM collection, and that it includes quite a few games and interactive demos. This is helpful when writing an emulator, because programs of different complexity which exercise the machine in different ways are ideal for testing.

**Decimal computers with variable-length data words** like the 1620 are also interesting because their operation corresponds more closely to a **Turing machine** than binary computers with a fixed word size: E.g. a Turing machine can add two decimal numbers which are next to each other on the tape by performing addition digit by digit. (There are online Turing machine simulators that demonstrate this kind of program.) The 1620 also works digit by digit and—since it has no adder—it even uses a lookup table (somewhat like a state transition table in a Turing machine) to perform addition and multiplication. When the 1620 is running a program, it spends a lot of its time either searching left until it finds a flag bit on the high digit of a number or searching left or right until it hits a record mark, therefore the **(at least vague) similarity to a Turing machine** is pretty clear.

### Power of 2 demo program from the Computer History Museum

![Py1620](py1620.png "Power of Two output in IBM 1403 font")

The program is loaded from the CMEM file. Computing 2**9999 takes about 35 seconds on a PC, so this particular program is about 35x as fast in Py1620 as on a real IBM 1620.

Also see this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4JH26yF_u0) of Power of Two running on the [1620 Junior](https://github.com/IBM-1620) emulator.

### Blackjack

After the program has explained the sense switch settings, it will enter an infinite loop. Press Ctrl-C to start the debugger, then toggle sense switch 1 and continue. This will begin the game.

This game is very similar to the [blackjack game by Mel Kaye](https://datatravelandexperiments.com/kps/sw/lgp/) (famous for "[The Story of Mel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Mel)") for the [LGP-30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGP-30). Both games also use the five-card rule (or five-card trick), so the player always wins if he has five cards (or more).

The player's cards are in the left column; the computer's in the right column. On Linux, the program's output can be improved with the ```tabs``` command, e.g. ```tabs -16``` sets the terminal to 16-character-wide tab stops that work well with this game.

### Block letters on punch cards

The block.txt program outputs block letters on punch cards, with either one or two lines of text on a card and up to 10 characters per line.

Each card is fed into the punch six times: 3x the normal way to print the upper half; then 3x flipped and rotated to print the lower half. When setting the number of cards to 1, this will produce a six-line output file from the emulator.

### Day of the week (programmed in Fortran)

This Fortran program calculates the day of the week for a given date.

The IBM 1620 product specifications are dated January 6, 1960. Entering this date into the program produces the correct answer that this was a Wednesday:

```
$ python3 py1620.py cal.txt 

BEGIN EXECUTION.

```

### GOTRAN

GOTRAN is an interactive Fortran-like programming language for the IBM 1620. A program is entered from the typewriter (or read from cards) and after a final ```END``` statement, the machine halts. Starting the machine runs the program. Then it halts again and the next program can be entered.

Here are three GOTRAN programs. The first one computes the sine for different angles, the second one the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio, and the third one computes the golden ratio directly:

#### Reading a GOTRAN program from punch cards

If sense switch 1 is set, GOTRAN will read and run programs from the punch card reader instead of the typewriter. A new card reader input file has to be attached from the debugger after GOTRAN has loaded:

### PDQ Fortran

PDQ Fortran does not need floating point instructions (unlike IBM Fortran), so it works with this emulator.

First, create a new card deck which contains the Fortran compiler, the source code to be compiled, and one of the (free or fixed format) Fortran subroutine decks. (Note that the Fortran source code should not have extra newlines at the end, as this would introduce empty cards into the deck!)

```$ cat pdq.txt test.f pdq-fixed.txt > pdq-deck.txt```

Then run that deck to compile your program and get an object deck:

```
$ python3 py1620.py pdq-deck.txt 0101 test.txt

### Symbolic Programming System (assembler)

Here is the assembly source file hello.sps. Labels start in column 6, mnemonics in column 12, and arguments in column 16:

```
     START WATYHELLO
           H
     HELLO DAC 12,HELLO WORLD@
           DENDSTART
```

The program prints (```WATY```) the hello string defined with ```DAC``` and then halts (```H```).  "@" is a record mark. ```DEND``` ("define end") has to be the final instruction.

This is a two-pass assembler, so the source file has to be read twice:

```
$ python3 py1620.py sps.txt 1010 hello.txt

*** HALT at 0; press Return to continue; enter 'h' for help or 'q' to quit

### CU01 general op codes diagnostic

Py1620 now completes this important IBM 1620 self test successfully. Tests 51 to 55 have been disabled because Py1620 does not use addition tables.

Testing takes about 5 seconds on a PC, as opposed to 150 seconds on a real IBM 1620, so it is about 30x as fast.
